### Welcome to my graphics works!
The works below have been done in OpenGL, in NUS's Computer Graphics Course.

 **Lab 1 - Bouncing Circles**
By making use of the correct event callback functions, we draw circles and implement its logic in the space, making it look like a dvd player screensaver.

**Lab 2 - Need for Speed**
By understanding projection, and view transformation, we learn how to provide suitable gluLookAt, and providing a correct glPerspective (another implementation of glFrustum), we manage to give the correct implementation to the rendering pipeline, which allows our camera to rotate and orbit around the planet correctly.
